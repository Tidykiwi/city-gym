Database application with GUI for managing gym memberships.<br>
Completetd as part of studying 'BIT502 - Fundamentals of Programming' at The Open Polytechnic of New Zealand (BIT = Bachelor of Information Technology)<br><br>

My task for this project was to build a multi-screen GUI database application to manage gym registration and membership.<br>

The brief asked for the folowing screens:<br>
• The main menu screen: The user should be able to navigate to the individual screens, to easily return to it, and to be able to exit the application.
• The membership form screen: This membership form calculates the membership costs and stores the new membership details to a database.
• Form to include customer details, membership details, payment details and extras.
• Form to include a ‘calculate’ button, that applies all fees and discounts, based on the user’s selection of options.
• Membership costs are displayed to the user on calculation. This includes:
o membership cost
o total of all extras selected
o total discount applied
o net membership cost
o regular payment amount.
• The submit button should store new member information in a database. This captures all details from the membership form.

• Search members screen: Uses a data grid to allow searching for members.<br><br>

• Fitness class booking screen: This form is a prototype only. It only features the functionality to close the form and return the user to the main menu 
screen.<br><br>

• Application includes suitable error control by informing the user if there areincomplete fields or incorrect user input.
