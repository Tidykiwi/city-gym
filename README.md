Database application with GUI for managing gym memberships.<br>
Completetd as part of studying 'BIT502 - Fundamentals of Programming' at The Open Polytechnic of New Zealand (BIT = Bachelor of Information Technology)

You will then create the following screens:
• The main menu screen: The user should be able to navigate to the individual 
screens, to easily return to it, and to be able to exit the application. 
• The membership form screen: You will have already completed the 
membership form from Assignment 2. However, you will now need to make 
sure that when the new member is saved, the information is stored in the
database rather than written to a file.

• Search members screen: To meet the requirements of being able to search 
for members (see Appendix A), you will need to add a data grid to this form.
• Fitness class booking screen: You will need to build this form into your 
Visual Studio solution. However, the only code you will need to add to this 
form is the code to close the form and return the user to the main menu 
screen. The form is a prototype only.
Then, create the database you designed for Task 1, and configure the data source to 
display tables.
You will also need to populate the database with the sample data (see Appendix B).
Remember, your design should capture all of the client’s requirements that are 
outlined in the case study information. For the implementation of this task, you will be 
assessed on your ability to meet the client’s requirements, the functionality of overall 
application, and the readability of your code.
